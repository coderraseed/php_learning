/*
PHP variables:
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).
Rules for PHP variables:
    
-> A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
-> A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
-> A variable name cannot start with a number
-> A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
-> Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

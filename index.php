/* What is OOP?
 *
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in PHP is a programming paradigm that allows developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by organizing it into objects.

In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, and objects are instances of that class. Each object has properties (also called attributes) and methods. Properties are the data associated with an object, and methods are the actions that an object can perform.

OOP in PHP provides several benefits, such as code reusability, encapsulation, and abstraction. It allows developers to write code that is easier to maintain and extend, and it promotes better code organization and structure.

Some of the OOP features in PHP include classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, interfaces, and traits. OOP is widely used in PHP development, and it is considered an essential skill for PHP developers.

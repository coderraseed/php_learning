/* * What is object oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

A common feature of objects is that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as this or self used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include: Java, C++, C#, Python, R, PHP, Visual Basic.NET, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, SIMSCRIPT, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Common Lisp, MATLAB, and Smalltalk.



 * * OOP basic:
Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function



 * * The (4) pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

01: Encapsulation: This is the idea of bundling data and related behavior together into a single unit, known as a class. The internal details of the class are hidden from the outside world, which allows developers to modify the class without affecting other parts of the code. In PHP, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected.

02: Abstraction: This is the concept of creating simplified representations of complex systems, which can be easily understood and used by developers. Abstraction in PHP involves defining abstract classes and interfaces that specify the methods and properties that a class must have, without providing the implementation details.

03: Inheritance: This is the idea of creating new classes that are built upon existing classes. The new class, known as the subclass, inherits the properties and methods of the existing class, known as the superclass. In PHP, inheritance is achieved using the "extends" keyword.

04: Polymorphism: This is the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, as long as they implement the same methods and properties. Polymorphism in PHP is achieved through interfaces, which specify the methods that a class must have, and traits, which allow developers to reuse code across multiple classes.

These four pillars form the foundation of OOP in PHP, and they help developers create code that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. By using these concepts, developers can write code that is more efficient, extensible, and flexible.
